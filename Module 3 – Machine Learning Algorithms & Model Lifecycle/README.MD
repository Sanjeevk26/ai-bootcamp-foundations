# Module 3 – Machine Learning Algorithms & Model Lifecycle
## From Learning Types to Deployment

In this module, we move from data into algorithms.

Previously, we explored:
- Data types
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning workflow

Now we focus on:

- The four types of Machine Learning
- Common algorithms and their use cases

This module explains how models actually learn and how they move into real-world usage.

# The Four Types of Machine Learning

There are four major learning paradigms in Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning  
2. Unsupervised Learning  
3. Semi-Supervised Learning  
4. Reinforcement Learning  

---

# 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is like cooking with a recipe book.

You are given:
- Ingredients (features)
- The final dish (label/output)

In machine learning terms, this means the model is trained on labeled data.

Each training example includes:
- Input (features)
- Correct output (label)

Example:
If you show the model 1,000 images and label each one as:
- Dog
- Cat
- Rat

The model learns by comparing:
- Its prediction
- The correct answer

It adjusts itself based on the difference.

## Real-Life Examples

- Email spam detection
- Image classification (dog vs cat)
- Credit risk prediction
- House price prediction

Supervised learning works best when you have clear labeled data.

---

# 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is like cooking without a recipe.

You have:
- Ingredients (data)
- No instructions
- No final labeled outcome

The model must discover patterns on its own.

There are no predefined labels.

The system tries to:
- Find groups
- Detect patterns
- Identify clusters
- Detect anomalies

## Real-Life Examples

- Customer segmentation
- Market grouping
- Music playlist grouping
- Fraud anomaly detection

Example:
A music streaming service may not have labeled genres for every song. Instead, it analyzes listening behavior and groups similar songs together.

Unsupervised learning finds structure in unlabeled data.

---

# 3. Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines supervised and unsupervised learning.

You have:
- A small amount of labeled data
- A large amount of unlabeled data

Example:
Learning a sport with:
- Some coaching sessions (labeled data)
- A lot of self-practice (unlabeled data)

The model uses labeled data for initial direction and then improves by learning from unlabeled data.

## Real-Life Example

Plant recognition apps:
- Start with labeled plant images
- Improve accuracy using large amounts of unlabeled images

This method is common when labeling data is expensive.

---

# 4. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is learning through trial and error.

There is:
- An agent (decision-maker)
- An environment
- A reward function
- A penalty (optional)

The agent:
- Takes actions
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Adjusts behavior accordingly

Example:
Learning to play a video game.
You try different moves.
You fail.
You learn.
You improve.

## Real-Life Examples

- Autonomous driving
- Robotics
- Game AI
- Dynamic pricing optimization

If the action leads to good results → reward  
If the action leads to poor results → penalty  

Over time, the agent maximizes reward.

# Common Machine Learning Algorithms

There are many algorithms in Machine Learning. Below are some commonly used ones and their applications.

---

## Naive Bayes Classifier

Used for:
- Email spam filtering
- Text classification

How it works:
Analyzes word frequencies and probabilities to classify text as spam or not spam.

---

## K-Means Clustering

Used for:
- Market segmentation
- Customer grouping
- Behavioral clustering

How it works:
Groups data into clusters based on similarity.

---

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Used for:
- Image classification
- Face detection
- Text classification

How it works:
Finds a boundary that best separates different classes.

---

## Linear Regression

Used for:
- House price prediction
- Sales forecasting
- Demand prediction

How it works:
Predicts a continuous numerical value.

Example:
Predicting house price based on:
- Square footage
- Bedrooms
- Location

---

## Logistic Regression

Used for:
- Credit scoring
- Loan default prediction
- Disease prediction

How it works:
Predicts probability of a binary outcome.

Example:
Will this customer default? (Yes/No)

---

## Artificial Neural Networks

Used for:
- Deep learning tasks
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles

Inspired by the human brain structure.

---

## Decision Tree

Used for:
- Medical diagnosis
- Risk classification
- Rule-based prediction

How it works:
Splits data based on decision rules.

---

## Random Forest

Used for:
- Fraud detection
- Risk modeling
- Complex classification tasks

How it works:
Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

---

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Used for:
- Recommendation systems
- Pattern recognition
- Similarity-based classification

Example:
If users similar to you liked Movie B after watching Movie A, the system recommends Movie B.

---

# Model Training

Model training is like preparing for a marathon.

The model:
- Sees training data
- Learns patterns
- Adjusts internal parameters

The first version is rarely perfect.

Improvement comes through repetition and adjustment.

Example:
A streaming recommendation system trains on millions of songs and user preferences to learn listening behavior.

---

# Model Evaluation

After training, we must evaluate the model.

We use test data (previously unseen).

Common evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Evaluation answers:
- Is the model reliable?
- Is it biased?
- Is it overfitting?

Sometimes evaluation includes human feedback.

---

# Model Tuning

If performance is poor, we tune the model.

This includes:
- Adjusting hyperparameters
- Changing model architecture
- Improving features
- Retraining with better data

This is iterative:
Train → Evaluate → Tune → Repeat

---

# Model Deployment

Deployment means putting the model into real-world use.

This is when:
- The spam filter runs live
- The recommendation engine suggests content
- Fraud detection blocks suspicious transactions

Deployment introduces real-world challenges:
- New types of data
- Changing environments
- Different system loads
- Unexpected behavior

---

# Model Inference

Inference happens after deployment.

It is the process of:
- Taking new input
- Running it through the model
- Producing a prediction

Example:
You open a streaming app.
The system recommends a song.
That recommendation is inference.

---

# Complete Machine Learning Lifecycle

1. Collect data  
2. Clean and preprocess data  
3. Select algorithm  
4. Train model  
5. Evaluate performance  
6. Tune model  
7. Deploy model  
8. Monitor and update  

This cycle continues.

Machine Learning is not a one-time activity.
It is an ongoing process.

- Algorithms solve different types of problems.
- Training is only the beginning.
- Evaluation and tuning are critical.
- Deployment introduces real-world complexity.
- Inference is when users experience the model.
